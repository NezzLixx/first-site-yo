            <h1>A NEW SAGA BEGINS</h1>
            <p>The Witcher 4 is a single-player, open-world RPG from CD PROJEKT RED, marking the beginning of a new saga in the Witcher universe. Built on Unreal Engine 5, the game promises cutting-edge graphics, realistic physics, and a deeply immersive atmosphere, making it the most ambitious and technologically advanced Witcher game to date.

                This time, players will step into the shoes of Ciri â€” a witcher and professional monster slayer with unique abilities. Following the events of The Witcher 3, where her fate depended on player choices, she now becomes the main protagonist of a brand-new story. Her journey leads through a dark and brutal fantasy world, filled with dangerous creatures, ancient mysteries, political intrigue, and morally complex decisions.

                The game will focus on deep character development, nonlinear storytelling, and meaningful choices that shape the narrative. The world will be open, dynamic, and full of life, offering a variety of regions to explore, quests to complete, unexpected encounters, and hidden secrets.
